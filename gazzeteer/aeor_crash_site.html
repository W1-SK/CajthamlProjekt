                <h1>Aeor Crash Site</h1>
                <p>03.06.2025</p>
            </div>
            <section id="contents">
                <p>While pieces of Aeor were thrown all over Eiselcross and the Frigid Depths, the city's main crash
                    initially created a three-mile-diameter crater in the center of Foren. In the centuries since, ice
                    covered the crater. Ruins poke through the frosty surface, creating tunnels, pits, and chasms. The
                    buried ruins are filled with dangerous, wonderful creations and pockets of people frozen in time.
                </p>
                <h2>Stasis Bubbles</h2>
                <p>Most of Aeor's streets, buildings, and people were smashed to pieces when the city collided with
                    Foren. Amid the ruins are magic fields of translucent blue force surrounding moments frozen in time.
                    Many of these bubbles hold diverse crowds of humanoids huddled in the street, their bodies, clothes,
                    belongings, and the ground itself unharmed by the crash. Others contain families holding hands as
                    they brace for impact around dining tables, mages waving wands in the air around laboratory benches,
                    soldiers with glowing swords raised to the sky, siege crews climbing atop weapons meant to fire
                    massive projectiles, and more. Each magic field is a 10-foot-radius sphere, and nothing within
                    appears damaged or moved by the crash.</p>
                <p>While these preserved scenes are sometimes useful for gathering information, the items and people
                    within are the real prize. Totally intact Aeorian technology is a rare find, but having even one of
                    Aeor's inventors or mages to demonstrate, repair, and rebuild their creations is a reward beyond any
                    of the other treasures the ruins hold. However, all attempts to dispel, break, or otherwise remove
                    the impenetrable magic barriers have failed. The people within appear frozen in time, but no
                    evidence suggests this stasis would change if the barriers dropped, or that the change would be for
                    the better. Some say the barriers dropping could cause the creatures within to age rapidly, turn to
                    dust, or go mad. Despite these warnings, explorers search Aeor's ruins for an item or spell that can
                    break these bubbles.</p>
                <p><b>Breaking the Bubbles.</b> If and how the stasis bubbles of Aeor can be broken is up to you, but
                    here are a few suggestions for solutions:</p>
                <h2>Arms and Armor</h2>
                <p>Aeorian technology was created to battle the gods and their servants. Explorers seek weapons and
                    armor, most of which is crafted to pierce divine defenses and guard against deific assaults. Weapons
                    as small as daggers and as large as cannons were crafted in Aeor. Although much was destroyed in the
                    crash, there are still items in the rubble. The pieces are valuable, and the blueprints for creating
                    such powerful items would be priceless, though none have been found so far.</p>
                <h2>Disease Laboratory</h2>
                <p>A large facility in the city developed diseases meant to weaken and kill the gods and their servants.
                    Aeor's mages tested the diseases on beasts and prisoners, creating horrific monsters, some of which
                    still stalk the ruins.</p>
                <p><b>Frigid Woe.</b> Frigid woe is a special disease developed by Aeor's mages that cannot be cured by
                    conventional treatment or magic. The only way a creature infected with the disease can be cured is
                    by finding and drinking the manufactured antidote, a milky liquid stored in gold vials found in
                    Eiselcross's ruins. This disease was created to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the
                    healing power of their clerics and angels.</p>
                <p>The disease is transmitted by breathing in blue spores that Aeor's mages created long ago. When a
                    creature comes into contact with these spores, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw
                    or become infected with frigid woe. It takes 1d4 days for the symptoms to manifest in an infected
                    creature. These symptoms include fatigue, chills, and visible blue veins that appear on the
                    creature's body. The infected creature's speed is reduced by 5 feet as long as it remains infected.
                    Every 10 days after symptoms appear, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
                    saving throw, or its speed is reduced by another 5 feet. If a creature's speed is reduced to 0 as a
                    result of this disease, the creature dies and its body turns into a statue made of ice.</p>
                <p>A creature can drink the antidote as an action, ending all symptoms and effects of the disease
                    instantly.</p>
                <h2>Aeorian Hunters</h2>
                <p>Aeor's people didn't just develop weapons that could kill the gods; they created soldiers. Strange
                    experiments turned captive beasts, prisoners, and volunteers into hulking dreadnoughts called
                    Aeorian hunters. Those that survived the crash still stalk the ruins, driven mad by isolation and
                    unsated bloodlust.</p>
                <h2>Strange Obelisk</h2>
                <p>A mile west of the crater that defines the crash site is a rocky hill that thaws any snow or ice that
                    rests atop it. The mouth of a cavern can be found on the hill's northern side, which leads to a
                    60-foot-wide, domed chamber. In the center of this cave stands a fifteen-foot-tall obelisk made of
                    dark, reflective metal that resembles smoothed obsidian. The stone quietly hums with an aura of
                    abjuration from some mysterious enchantment. Travelers that complete a long rest within proximity of
                    the stone are visited with terrible dreams of strange, alien places and visions difficult to
                    understand.</p>
